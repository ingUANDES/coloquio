From a portfolio management perspective, identifying bull and bear regimes is crucial for tactical asset allocation and market timing. Literature has documented a low correlation between the Equity Market and Cryptocurrency Assets, supporting that diversification benefits cryptocurrency allocations. We use a Bayesian Markov Switching Model to show that cryptocurrency and the stock markets have different bull and bear regime timings and that investors can increase their returns and reward-to-variability ratio by exploiting such differences in bull and bear regime timings with tactical asset allocation.
