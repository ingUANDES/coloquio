This paper assesses the effect of teacher gender on the academic performance of students in higher education, considering male- and female-dominated careers. We use rich administrative records of students, teachers and classes from a private university in Chile over a ten-year period. By focusing on first-semester students and estimating fixed-effects models to achieve identification, our findings indicate that teacher gender has an impact on grades. In female-dominated careers, only female students exhibit a positive effect (0.112 SD) from having a female teacher, in comparison to a male teacher. In male-dominated careers however, female teachers have a greater impact on student performance, improving female and male studentsâ€™ grades by 0.286 SD and 0.185 SD, respectively. Moreover, the positive effect of female teachers is more pronounced in larger classes and among high-achievement students. The heterogeneity in effects across careers suggests a nuanced interplay of teacher bias and role model, with female teachers potentially favoring female students and serving as aspirational figures for girls.
