We study the behavior of retail day traders to shed light on the causes of overconfidence in financial markets. We show these individuals assess their trading skills using a simple counting heuristic: the proportion of profitable days. This yields an upward-biased performance measure, as individuals exhibit a strong disposition effect that artificially inflates the proportion of profitable days. We develop and estimate a model showing that without the disposition effect, the counterfactual proportion of profitable days would be 47%, compared to the actual 53%. Our findings indicate that the disposition effect, along with simple heuristics for assessing performance, contributes to overconfidence.
