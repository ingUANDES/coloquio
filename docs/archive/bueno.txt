Selenium is a very important trace element from an ecotoxicological point of view due to the small
difference between its essential and toxic levels. Although Se is an essential element for animals
including humans, ingestion of an excess amount can produce adverse effect. Furthermore, among
different radionuclides, 79 Se is of environmental concern for safety assessment of nuclear waste
repositories because of its presence in high level long-lived nuclear wastes. Moreover, the toxic dose
of selenium is highly dependent on its chemical form, and therefore, the speciation becomes
necessary. Selenium can be found as inorganic compounds showing different oxidation state: -II, 0,
IV and VI, and also incorporated to aminoacids. While selenite(IV) and selenate(VI) are the most toxic
compounds, the seleno aminoacids are considered as more bioavailable. The result of selenium
detoxification pathway is the volatile alkyl selenides.
Our lab is interested since the 1990â€™s in selenium environmental chemistry, particularly in aquatic
systems where the low levels of selenium (often below 1 ppb) require low analytical detection limits.
Here different analytical strategies applied to several field or laboratory biogeochemical studies are
synthesized and discussed.
