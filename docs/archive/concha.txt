Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are endowed with an exquisite orientation mechanism allowing them to swim along the geomagnetic field lines. This mechanism consists of a chain of bio-synthesized magnetic nano-crystals that endow MTB with a permanent magnetic moment. Although the physics behind the minimum size of this biological compass is well understood, it is yet unclear what sets its maximum size. Here, by using a macroscopic experiment inspired in these microorganisms, we show that larger magnetic moments will drive the collective behavior of MTB into a phase where bacteria are unable to swim freely, in detriment of their evolutive fitness. Simple macroscopic experiments, numerical simulations, and analytic estimates are used to explain the upper limit for the size of the chain of nano-crystals in MTB. Our macroscopic bio-inspired experiment, and physical model provide new opportunities to explore and understand the phases of magnetic active matter at all scales.
