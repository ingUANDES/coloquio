The lakes of Northern Patagonia are some of the largest, pristine, temperate lakes on Earth and provide valuable economic, cultural and environmental benefits to Chile. However, the long-term trajectory of these systems is uncertain due to the potential impacts of watershed development and climate change on lake water quality. Since April 2021, the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center, in collaboration with Chile Lagos Limpios, has been conducting an intensive monitoring program for Lago Llaqnuihue, one of the largest and most iconic lakes in Chile. Utilizing high frequency temperature and oxygen data, researchers are calibrating a three-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model, capable of simulating the lakeâ€™s physical response to meteorological forcing (e.g., wind and solar radiation). Once validated, this model will be utilized to investigate the impacts of a range of down-scaled climate scenarios on lake physics and water quality. This talk will focus on the methodologies and challenges with development and calibration of hydrodynamic lake models.
