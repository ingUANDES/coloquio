For the last 60 years, Moore's Law has been in full swing, providing a technological boost every two years to meet the continuosly growing compute requirements. However, in recent years, Moore's Law has begun to slow down, and simultaneously, the computational requirements of Machine Learning have grown exponentially. These trends are forcing the industry to explore improvements at each level of the system, from new semiconductor technologies to the distribution of compute across the system. In this talk, we will explore some of these approaches, such as Embedded Non-Volatile Memories, 3D Integration, TinyML Compression Techniques, and Distributed On-Sensor Compute.
