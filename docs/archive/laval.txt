It was recently shown that an analogy exists between the flow of traffic in congested cities and the phase transition of simple fluids, whereby the concept of temperature corresponds to the flow of vehicles. This talk explores the meaning of thermodynamics in the case of traffic flow based on this analogy. We investigate both the non-equilibrium “morning commute” problem and the equilibrium steady-state behavior of cities by re-analyzing the heat engine, and the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics, respectively. We identify interpretations for work, Clausius’ entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics. We discuss the meaning of Boltzmann’s constant and its role in the continuity equation, which leads to the interesting observation that the number of micro configurations in equilibrium is approximately constant.
