The growing concern about the impact of multiple hazard sources on interconnected structural systems within urban areas has been a research focus in recent years. As a result, regional multi-hazard risk studies have emerged as a response to the need for expanding current methodologies in structural performance analysis, shifting towards an approach that considers the impacts on geographically distributed civil systems under various hazards. This broader perspective enables professionals to make more informed decisions with reduced uncertainty in disaster risk management planning. This study aims to establish a probabilistic framework for regional multi-hazard risk assessment, integrating seismic and hydraulic hazards (local scour) into the dynamic response estimation of bridge portfolios in Chile. The proposed framework extends the well-known Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) methodology to a regional context, referred to as Regional Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (RPBEE), which is gaining attention in the academic field. This framework incorporates the interaction of multiple hazards and utilizes innovative data-driven techniques for risk estimation and uncertainty quantification (UQ).
