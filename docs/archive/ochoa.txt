This work utilizes the one-domain approach (ODA) to examine momentum transport in a two-dimensional, incompressible single-phase flow within a system that includes both free-flow and a porous medium. A key feature of this ODA is that it is based on generalized transport equations (GTEs) derived using the volume averaging method on the pore-scale equations. Unlike other GTEs in the literature, this approach incorporates two Brinkman corrections and a Darcy term, employing a well-defined position-dependent porosity and permeability tensor.
To assess the performance of the ODA, fluid flow is analyzed in three different systems that are partially filled with a porous medium: a lid-driven cavity, a rectangular channel, and a filtration rectangular cavity. The accuracy of the ODA is assessed by comparing the average profiles it generates with those derived from averaging pore-scale profiles obtained from pore-scale simulations (PSSs). 
The results indicate that the average velocity and pressure profiles calculated from the ODA solution align closely with those from the PSSs across the entire system, including the wall/porous medium, the porous medium/free-flow, and the free-flow/wall inter-regions. These findings hold true regardless of the flow&#39;s driving force, flow direction, or the microstructure of the porous medium. Ultimately, the ODA derived from VAM can be applied to investigate one- and two-dimensional flows in various free-flow/porous medium systems.
