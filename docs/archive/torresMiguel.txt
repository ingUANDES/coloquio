High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) systems enhance the AC grid’s control and stability, especially in low-inertia conditions where static converter-interfaced generation negatively impacts rotating synchronous generators’ (SG) operation. This issue has received significant attention in the latest research, and state-of-the-art solutions typically entail controlling the HVDC converter stations to act as virtual SGs (VSG). However, a critical problem of HVDC systems is their limited effectiveness in supporting frequency control simultaneously on the interconnected AC grids since their inability to store extra energy. This talk will discuss ideas on how to address this issue using a battery energy storage system (BESS) integrated into a coordinated VSG control strategy.
