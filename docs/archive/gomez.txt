While Operational Research (OR) models traditionally assume that the key parameters of the optimization problem are fully known, or, otherwise, they follow a known random distribution, there are many real world problems in which parameters are not known, but statistically related with a bunch of easy to obtain variables which can be used, via available Machine Learning (ML) approaches, to estimate the uncertain parameters. For example, in delivery problems,  demands or travel times might be uncertain at the time of decision-making ---e.g., day-ahead production planning---, and auxiliary data (e.g., day of the week, traffic congestion, web searches or weather conditions) can be used to predict them.

Predict-and-optimize models address OR problems with uncertain parameters by using state of the art ML models to predict such parameters, the prediction being embedded in the decision-making problem. In this talk, we present a new neural-networks-based Predict-and-optimize  model,  which trades off accuracy with explainability, since it identifies the most relevant features affecting decision-making. The numerical experience reported shows that our ExPnO gives a valuable trade-off between accuracy (optimality gap) and explainability (sparsity) and it is competitive against benchmark Predict-and-optimize approaches.
