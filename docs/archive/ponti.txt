This talk has two parts: in the first, two self-supervised tasks on three distinct image domains are described, allow to learn discriminative representations in scenarios of low labeled data regime, with improved robustness to 1-pixel attacks. Secondly, Scene Designer is introduced. It is a novel method for Compositional Sketch-based Image Retrieval (CSBIR) that combines semantic layout synthesis with its main task both to boost performance and enable new creative workflows. Instead of using a single sketch for single-object retrieval, we look to multi-object scenes instead for increased query specificity and flexibility.
