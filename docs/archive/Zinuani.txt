In the first part of the workshop, the basic DEA model will be presented with its development over the years, highlighting ranking in the DEA context. DEA measures the efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) based on their multiple inputs and multiple outputs – the main models will be reviewed. DEA basically divides the DMUs into two groups – efficient and inefficient. To fully rank the DMUs in the DEA context, several methods were developed – the main models will be presented. In the second part, we concentrate on a specific case study: ranking higher education efficiency in OECD countries, to show the strength and potential of DEA.

Studies of productivity of Higher Education (HE) on the national level are of interest for two main reasons: education is an important factor for productivity growth for the macro-economy, and the efficiency of spending public resources on HE is of key interest in the context of accountability specifically relative efficiency compared with other developed countries. The objective of this case study is to evaluate the relative efficiency of HE in OECD countries from the public viewpoint; how well OECD countries utilize their public resources to achieve their outputs relative to each other. For this study, two inputs and six outputs were used. The data was taken, mostly, from OECD reports on education in 2019. The stress on efficiency from the public viewpoint is a strength of this study in relation to previous OECD efficiency studies. Several DEA models were used, which provide dichotomy of the countries into two groups: efficient and inefficient. Moreover, several efficiency rank-scaling methods based on DEA, and several multivariate statistic methods were utilized here.
