Biogas, derived from anaerobic digestion of organic matter, is a source of renewable energy with
high energy and environmental potential. It is a complex mixture that contains different types of
trace compounds, in varying amounts depending on the substrates, which can damage the storage
and upgrading units (corrosion phenomena, toxic emissions).
The main objectives of BIOCAD are to study and demonstrate the use of digestate obtained from
anaerobic digestion of biomass to produce biochar-derived carbon (by pyrolysis) and to be used as a
value-added product for adsorption with application to biogas treatment.
